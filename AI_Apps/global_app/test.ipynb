       "AIMessage(content=\"ICU Medical, Inc. is a company that specializes in the development, manufacture, and sale of innovative medical devices designed to improve patient care and enhance the safety and efficiency of IV therapy. Their product portfolio includes needle-free connectors, extension sets, secondary sets, administration sets, anesthesia sets, stopcocks, manifolds, blood sets, disinfecting caps, and renal systems. These products aim to minimize infection risks, reduce medication errors, and streamline clinical protocols across different healthcare settings.\\n\\nOne of their flagship technologies is the Clave™ needle-free connector, which is designed to provide a safe and effective microbial barrier. This barrier helps to minimize infection risks by preventing the transfer of microbes through the IV line. The Clave technology is integrated into various ICU Medical products, including administration sets and extension sets, to maintain a closed system throughout the medication delivery process. This approach helps to reduce the risks associated with open systems, such as bacterial contamination and bloodstream infections.\\n\\nICU Medical's products are designed with efficiency in mind, allowing healthcare professionals to deliver medications and flush IV lines without the need to connect and disconnect flush devices. This not only saves time but also helps to reduce the risk of drug mixing and microbial contamination. Their multi-lumen extension sets facilitate safe and efficient access to patients' IV lines, further enhancing clinical efficiency.\\n\\nFor oncology care, ICU Medical offers systems that are tailored to minimize hazardous drug exposure, thus protecting both patients and healthcare workers. Their products are designed to fit seamlessly into existing clinical workflows, helping to enhance patient safety, improve clinical efficiency, and maximize profitability.\\n\\nIn addition to their product offerings, ICU Medical provides a comprehensive infusion assessment program aimed at helping healthcare facilities standardize and streamline their infusion therapy protocols. This program involves on-site assessments, evidence-based recommendations, and a roadmap for standardization, all designed to support infection control best practices and efficient supply chain management.\\n\\nOverall, ICU Medical is committed to delivering innovative solutions that enhance patient care by improving the safety and efficiency of IV therapy across various clinical settings.\", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 407, 'prompt_tokens': 13246, 'total_tokens': 13653}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4-turbo-preview', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_a7daf7c51e', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})"

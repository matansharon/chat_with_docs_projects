      "The 2024 United States presidential election will be the 60th quadrennial presidential election, set to be held on Tuesday, November 5, 2024.[1] Voters will elect a president and vice president for a term of four years. Incumbent President Joe Biden, a member of the Democratic Party, is running for re-election.[2] His predecessor Donald Trump, a member of the Republican Party, is running for re-election for a second, non-consecutive term.[3] This will mark the seventh presidential rematch in American history and the first since 1956. If Trump wins, he would become the second president to serve a non-consecutive term, the first being Grover Cleveland.\n",
      "The winner of this election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. It will occur at the same time as elections relating to the U.S. Senate, House, gubernatorial, and state legislative. On March 12, Biden and Trump became the presumptive nominees for the Democratic and Republican parties respectively by clinching a majority of delegates, although they have yet to be confirmed at the nominating conventions.[4] Robert F. Kennedy Jr. emerged as the highest-polling third-party presidential candidate since Ross Perot[5] in the 1992 and 1996 elections, running as an independent.[6][7][8]\n",

      "Abortion,[9][10] immigration, healthcare,[11] education,[12] the economy,[13] foreign policy,[14] border security,[15] LGBT rights,[16] climate change,[17] and democracy[18][19][20] are expected to be leading campaign issues. \n",
      "Background\n",
      "Procedure\n",
      "Main article: United States presidential election ¬ß Procedure\n",
      "Article Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. The Twenty-second Amendment forbids any person from being elected president more than twice. Major party candidates seek the nomination through a series of primary elections that select the delegates who choose the candidate at the party's national convention. Each party's national convention chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that party's ticket. The nominee for president usually picks the running mate, who is then ratified by the delegates at the party's convention.\n",
      "The general election in November is an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.[21]\n",
      "Election offices are dealing with increased workloads and public scrutiny, so officials in many key states have sought for more funds to hire more personnel, improve security, and extend training. This demand emerges at a moment when numerous election offices are dealing with an increase in retirements and a flood of public record demands, owing in part to the electoral mistrust planted by former President Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 election. Both Biden and Trump are running for president in 2024, suggesting a potential rematch of the 2020 election, which would be the first presidential rematch since 1956.[22] If Trump is elected, he would become the second president to win a second non-consecutive term, joining Grover Cleveland who did so in 1892.[23]\n",
      "The Colorado Supreme Court,[24] a state Circuit Court in Illinois,[25] and the Secretary of State of Maine[26] ruled that Trump is ineligible to hold office under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution for his role in the January 6 Capitol attack, and as such, attempted to disqualify him from appearing on the ballot.[27][26] However, on March 4, the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled that states cannot determine eligibility for a national election under Section 3.[28]\n",

      "Donald Trump did not concede to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, citing false claims of voter fraud, and has continued denying the election results as of February 2024[update].[29][30] Election security experts have warned that officials who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election may attempt to impede the voting process or refuse to certify the 2024 election results.[31]\n",
      "Polling before the election has indicated profound dissatisfaction with the state of American democracy.[32][33][34] Liberals tend to believe that conservatives are threatening the country with autocratic tendencies and their attempts to overturn the 2020 election.[35] Many Republicans are concerned with attempts to prevent former President Trump from holding public office by any means necessary, including impeachment and indictment.[36]\n",

      "This will be the first U.S. presidential election to occur after the reapportionment of votes in the United States Electoral College following the 2020 United States census.[37][38] If the results of the 2020 election were to stay the same (which has never occurred in the history of presidential elections) in 2024, Democrats would have 303 electoral votes against the Republicans' 235, a slight change from Biden's 306 electoral votes and Trump's 232, meaning that Democrats lost a net of 3 electoral votes to the reapportionment process. This apportionment of electoral college votes will remain only through the 2028 election. Reapportionment will be conducted again after the 2030 United States census.[39]\n",

      "In recent presidential elections, most states are not competitive due to demographics keeping them solidly behind one of the major parties. Because of the nature of the Electoral College, this means that the various swing states ‚Äî competitive states that \"swing\" between the Democratic and Republican parties ‚Äî are vital to winning the presidency. As of now, these include states in the Rust Belt, such as Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and states in the Sun Belt, such as Nevada, Arizona, and Georgia.[40] North Carolina may also be considered a battleground state, due to the close result in the previous presidential election, in which Trump only won by 1.34%.[41] Due to gradual demographic shifts, some former swing states such as Iowa, Ohio and Florida have shifted significantly towards the Republicans, favoring them in future statewide and local elections. Meanwhile, states like Colorado, New Mexico and Virginia have moved noticeably towards the Democrats, and the party has become the dominant political force there.[42][43][44]\n",
      "The Democratic electoral coalition, securing the \"blue states\" for Democratic presidential candidates, performs best among Jewish and Black voters;[45][46] Whites who have attended college[47] or live in urban areas.[48] Working class voters were also a mainstay of the Democratic coalition since the days of the New Deal, but since the 1970s, many have defected to Republicans as the Democratic Party moved significantly to the left on cultural issues.[49] Conversely, the traditional Republican coalition that dominates many \"red states\" is mainly composed of rural White voters, evangelicals, the elderly, and non-college educated voters.[50]  Republicans have also historically performed well with suburban, middle class voters since the 1950s, but this bloc has drifted away from them in recent years due to the rise of the Tea Party movement and later the Make America Great Again movement.[51] The acceleration of this trend has been credited with tipping the 2020 presidential election in favor of Democrat Joe Biden, because the incumbent Trump was historically unpopular in the suburbs for a Republican candidate, underperforming there significantly.[52]\n",
      "Some polling for this election has indicated that Democratic strength among Hispanic, Asian, Arab, and youth voters appears to have somewhat eroded, while Republicans' durability with Whites and voters over the age of 65 also appears to be slipping.[53][54][55][56][57] However, some political analysts[58] have argued that these apparent trends in polling are not representative of the actual electorate, and are a polling mirage resulting from poor sampling months before the election, large numbers of voters who do not think the election will be between Biden and Trump,[59] and heavy non-response bias.[60][61][62][63] Other pollsters, such as YouGov, have shown no statistically significant generational or racial depolarization among the electorate.[64][65]\n",

      "Main article: Abortion in the United States\n",
      "Abortion access is expected to be a key topic during the campaign. This is the first presidential election to be held in the aftermath of two major court rulings that affected access to abortion. The first is the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, in which the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, leaving abortion law entirely to the states, including bans on abortion.[66] The second is the 2023 Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in which a federal judge in northwest Texas overturned the FDA's approval of mifepristone in 2000, which could potentially pull the medication from the market if upheld by higher courts.[67] Both rulings have received strong support from Republican politicians and lawmakers.[66][67]\n",
      "Democrats are predominantly supportive of viewing abortion access as a right[68] while Republican politicians generally favor significantly restricting the legality of abortion.[69] By April 2023, a large majority of Republican-controlled states had passed near-total bans on abortion, rendering it \"largely illegal\" throughout much of the United States. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there are 15 states that have de jure early stage bans on abortion without exceptions for rape or incest.[66]\n",
      "Biden has called on Congress to codify abortion protections into federal law, and held many rallies on the issue.[70][71] Trump has claimed credit for overturning Roe but has criticized Republicans pushing for total abortion bans.[72][73]\n",

      "Donald Trump has stated that if elected, he would increase deportations, send the U.S. military to the border, expand ICE detentions, deputize local law enforcement to handle border security, increase Customs and Border Patrol funding as well as finish building the wall on the southern border.[77] The Biden administration has undertaken a policy of providing temporary protections to migrants from certain countries such as Venezuela, Ukraine, Nicaragua, Cuba and Haiti.[77] In February 2024, Biden and congressional negotiators reached an agreement on a bill to secure the border, but the bill was opposed by Trump. Biden has pushed back on Republican claims that he could secure the border without Congress.[79]\n",

      "Joe Biden has been framing the election as a battle for democracy, which was similar to his framing of contemporary geopolitics as \"the battle between democracy and autocracy.\"[81] Biden's rhetoric previously cited democracy and \"a battle for the soul of our nation\" as the key message of his 2020 presidential campaign, and uses it as a recurring element in his rhetoric since the 2020 presidential election.[19]\n",
      "Donald Trump's 2024 campaign has been criticized by the media for making increasingly violent and authoritarian statements,[82][83][84] which some believe the Trump campaign is intentionally leaning into.[85] Trump's previous comments suggesting he can \"terminate\" the Constitution to reverse his election loss,[86][87] his claim that he would only be a dictator on \"day one\" of his presidency and not after,[a] his promise to use the Justice Department to go after his political enemies,[94] attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, continued Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election, and Trump's baseless predictions of vote fraud in the 2024 election,[95] have raised concerns over the state of democracy in America.[85][96][97][98]\n",
      "Democracy is expected to be a large issue in the 2024 election. An AP-NORC poll of 1,074 adults conducted between November 30 to December 4, 2023, found that 62% of adults said democracy could be at risk depending on who wins the next election.[99]\n",

      "Women were particularly affected by the economic downturn in the wake of the pandemic, particularly those who left their work for childcare responsibilities.[107] Temporary childcare measures, including an expanded child tax credit as part of the American Rescue Plan, were introduced as methods designed to help the economic situation of parents, but these would expire before the 2024 election.[108]\n",
      "Both Biden and Trump signed pieces of economic legislation in their first terms which they may tout in the 2024 campaign.[109] Biden signed the American Rescue Plan,[110] Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,[111] Inflation Reduction Act,[112] CHIPS and Science Act,[113] and the Fiscal Responsibility Act.[114] Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,[115] the CARES Act,[116] and several executive orders providing for de-regulation.[117]\n",

      "Under the Biden administration, several rounds of student loan forgiveness have been issued, totaling over $132 billion. The forgiveness has largely focused on public servants, people who were defrauded, and people in repayment for long periods of time.[118] In August 2022, Biden announced he would sign an executive order that would forgive large amounts of student debt, including $10,000 for student loan debt for single graduates making less than $125,000 or married couples making less than $250,000 and $20,000 for recipients of Pell Grants.[119][120] In June 2023, this plan was overturned in the Supreme Court decision Biden v. Nebraska.[121][122] In the aftermath of the decision, Biden has continued with more limited student loan forgiveness.[118] His plans have been criticized by Republicans as irresponsible spending.[123] Biden stated that offering universal pre-kindergarten services as well as caregiver support would be a priority of a second term.[124]\n",
      "Some Republican candidates saw education as a winning campaign issue. Dozens of states have created laws preventing the instruction of critical race theory, an academic discipline focused on the examination of racial inequality. Supporters of the laws claim that conversations about racial identity are not appropriate for a school environment.[125][126][12] Critics of the laws against critical race theory claim they whitewash American history and act as memory laws to rewrite public memory of U.S. history.[127]\n",

      "During the Israel‚ÄìHamas war, Biden announced \"unequivocal\" military support for Israel, and condemned the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism.[135] Biden has requested 10.6 billion dollars of aid for Israel to Congress.[136] Biden's support for Israel has been criticized by progressives and Muslim leaders, many of whom have indicated they will not vote for Biden over the war.[137] Kennedy condemned Hamas' attacks on Israeli civilians and declared support for aid to Israel.[138] Trump has given mixed messages on the war, pledging to support Israel and take a tough line on Iran, while also criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and praising Hezbollah as \"very smart.\"[139][140]\n",

Additionally, he has endorsed the Equality Act, legislation aiming to extend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to offer protection on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation across various domains such as in the workplace, housing, and health care sectors. In 2023, Biden directed the federal government to provide strategies to states on how to enhance access to healthcare and suicide prevention resources for the LGBT community.[148]\n",

      "On April 25, 2023, President Joe Biden announced his run for re-election, keeping Vice President Kamala Harris as his running mate.[150][151] Consequently, Republicans have intensified their criticism of Harris since Biden declared his intention to run for office.[152] During late 2021, as Biden was facing low approval ratings, there was speculation that he would not seek re-election,[153] and some prominent Democrats (Representatives Carolyn Maloney, Tim Ryan and former Representative Joe Cunningham) publicly urged Biden not to run.[154][155][156] In addition to Biden's unpopularity, many are concerned about his age; he was the oldest person to assume the office at age 78 and would be 82 at the end of his first term. If re-elected, he would be 86 at the end of his second term.[157] According to an NBC poll released in April 2023, 70 percent of Americans‚Äîincluding 51 percent of Democrats‚Äîbelieve Biden should not run for a second term. Almost half said it was because of his age. According to the FiveThirtyEight national polling average, Biden's current approval rating is 41 percent, while 55 percent disapprove.[158] There was also speculation that Biden may face a primary challenge from a member of the Democratic Party's progressive faction.[159][160] After Democrats outperformed expectations in the 2022 midterm elections, many believed the chances that Biden would run for and win his party's nomination had increased.[161]\n",
      "Author Marianne Williamson announced her candidacy in February 2023, before Biden announced his own candidacy for re-election. Williamson had previously sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.[162] In April 2023, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his candidacy for the nomination.[163] Then on October 9, 2023, Kennedy announced that he would be dropping out of the Democratic primary and would instead run as an independent candidate.[164] Representative Dean Phillips announced his run against Biden on October 26.[165]\n",

      "Donald Trump, the then-incumbent president, was defeated by Biden in the 2020 election and is not term-limited to run again in 2024, making him the fifth ex-president to seek a second non-consecutive term. If he wins, Trump would be the second president to win a non-consecutive term, after Grover Cleveland in 1892.[178] Trump filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on November 15, 2022, and announced his candidacy in a speech at Mar-a-Lago the same day.[179][180] Trump is considered an early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, following his 2024 campaign announcement on November 15, 2022.[181] Trump announced in March 2022 that if he runs for re-election and wins the Republican presidential nomination, his former vice president Mike Pence will not be his running mate.[182]\n",
      "In March 2023, Trump was indicted over his hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.[183] Trump was again indicted in June over his handling of classified documents which contained materials sensitive to national security. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all the charges related to these indictments.[184][185]\n",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was seen as the main challenger to Trump for the Republican nomination; he raised more campaign funds in the first half of 2022 and had more favorable polling numbers than Trump by the end of 2022.[186][187][188]\n",
      "On May 24, 2023, DeSantis announced his candidacy on Twitter in an online conversation with Twitter CEO Elon Musk. \"American decline is not inevitable‚Äîit is a choice...I am running for president of the United States to lead our great American comeback\", DeSantis added. His campaign stated to have raised $1 million in the first hour following the announcement of his candidacy.[189] Speaking on Fox & Friends, he stated that he would \"destroy leftism\" in the United States.[190] At the end of July 2023, FiveThirtyEight's national polling average of the Republican primaries had Trump at 52 percent, and DeSantis at 15.[191]\n",
      "Following the Iowa caucuses, in which Trump posted a landslide victory, DeSantis and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump, leaving the former president and Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who served in Trump's cabinet, as the only remaining major candidates.[192][193] Trump continued to win all four early voting contests while Haley's campaign struggled to gain momentum.[194] On March 6, 2024, the day after winning only one primary out of fifteen on Super Tuesday, Haley suspended her campaign. Trump became the only remaining major candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.[195]\n",
      "On March 12, 2024, Trump officially became the presumptive Republican nominee.[196]\n",

They include socialist activist and intellectual Cornel West, who announced a campaign as an independent after initially announcing a run as a People's Party and later a Green Party candidate.[144] Centrist political organization No Labels confirmed in March 2024 it would field a third-party candidate.[221] Some established third parties, such as the American Solidarity Party, the Prohibition Party, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation have announced presidential nominees, while others, such as the Libertarian Party, the Green Party and the Constitution Party, have begun their primaries. While independent/third-party candidates often do better in opinion polls than actual election performance,[222], third-party candidates, as of October 2023, have the strongest showing in polls since Ross Perot's high poll numbers in the 1990s.[223]\n",

Kennedy and nephew of U.S. president John F. Kennedy and senator Ted Kennedy. On March 26, 2024, Kennedy announced Nicole Shanahan, an attorney from California, as his running mate.[239]\n",

Throughout the second half of the 20th century, Americans without college degrees were more likely than university graduates to vote Democratic. But that gap began narrowing in the late 1960s before finally flipping in 2004... A more educated Democratic coalition is, naturally, a more affluent one... In every presidential election from 1948 to 2012, white voters in the top 5 percent of America's income distribution were more Republican than those in the bottom 95 percent. Now, the opposite is true: Among America's white majority, the rich voted to the left of the middle class and the poor in 2016 and 2020, while the poor voted to the right of the middle class and the rich.\n",
